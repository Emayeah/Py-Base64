# Py-Base64
base64 encoder and decoder in python

## Usage
- Download the file
- Run it using `Python3 base.py` after cd-ing in the directory the python script is
- select 1 for encoding or 2 for decoding
- input the text
- the program will spit out the base64 version (or the original one if decode)


### Note
hopefully i don't have to say it but knowing what happened on the github reddit:
- Install python, you can install it from the site (if on windows this is not recommended, otherwise you need to set the paths) https://www.python.org or (the better alternative for windows) install it on the microsoft store
- download the python script in the tags
- open a cmd without admin (no this is not hacking)
- cd into the folder (for example, if you downloaded it on your download folder you need to do cd `Downloads`)
- execute the command i wrote in the usage section

have fun using it

if you find any bugs post it in the issues tab, i'll probably won't fix quickly since i dont really often check github
